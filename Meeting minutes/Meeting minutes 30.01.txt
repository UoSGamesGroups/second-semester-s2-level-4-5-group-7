All members in attendance

Discussed further possible ideas, the current working concept is a demolition derby game where players use an angry birds style system to propel cars into others, the players 
take turns to do this and whoever destroys their opponents cars will win. 

Divided up tasks for the run-up to the presentation.
Tom will create the presentation on Google docs (to later be uploaded to github when finished) to allow for group members to simultaneously add things to the presentation when needed
Oliver will create a prototype
Amy will create a sketched mockup of the game screen 
George will create some mood boards to describe the game
