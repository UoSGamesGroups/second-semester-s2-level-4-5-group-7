29/03/17 - 9:30 - 11:40 members arrived and 12:30-1pm following the presentation
Members in attendance: from 9:30, Oliver and Amy. From 10:00 Thomas. From 11:40, George

We have decided to reduce tasks to 3 hours per person, and 4 hours for Oliver due to Easter coming up and looming deadlines

Discussed the presentation and practiced it. 
Following the presentation we discussed what polishing tasks we could do, from feeback from the panel we have realised that we must 
find some way for risk/reward in our game, so Thomas and George have been given a task each to research other games and come up with a 
way that we can implement meaningful risk/reward in our game.
Amy has a task to polish some variables in the game relating to the black hole and rockets.
Oliver's tasks are to implement some assets created in the previous two weeks and to implement some final features discussed due to both 
playtesting and feedback from the panel.

Due to feeback from the panel, we will not be creating any new art assets.
