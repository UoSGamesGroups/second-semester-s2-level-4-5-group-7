Members in attendance:- Oliver, Tom, Amy

George's absence was explained via an email, Rob is aware of the reason

Discussed 4 main ideas during this meeting: 
 - A Street racing game, possibly akin to a 1v1 endless runner type game (top down)
 - A space racing game with the players able to affect the course of asteroids in order to "attack" their opponent
 - A game which involves being able to shoot a projectile and have it ricochet off of a surface to cause various objects in the environment to react in various ways
 - A game whereby both players must choose an area to place some explosives around a building, the player who destroys the most of their building wins.
 
 All group members have been assigned tasks to conduct some research into other possible physics based mechanics which may be implemented in a game, the results of which will be 
 discussed on monday during a group meeting.
