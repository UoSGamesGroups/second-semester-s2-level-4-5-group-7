No formal meeting this week, multiple emails have been sent in the previous week chasing up work from both George and Thomas, both were uncommunicative
until 27/04 when Thomas replied to the emails saying that he had been experiencing problems with 3DS max which had caused him to forgo finishing any group project
work. 

Work from before easter from both Thomas and George was unfinished and so has been reassigned for the coming week.
Amy has been issued a doctor's note due to acute tonsillitis saying that she is unfit for work for a week so her hours have been reduced to 3 this week to account for this.
Oliver has been assigned a full 6 hours.

Amy's tasks are to alter her background images to bring the colour scheme in line with the new colour scheme created before the easter break and 
to create a sprite to be implemented as visual feedback for the player that they have not been injured by blocking a projectile.


Oliver's tasks are to check the fidelity of numerous randomisation systems which were implemented and to implement the loss condition fully. 
Other tasks include implementing the work that Amy was set (BLOCKER) and creating the powerpoint presentation for the next presentation
