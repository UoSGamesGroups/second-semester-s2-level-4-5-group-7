Members in attendance: - Oliver, Tom, Amy
George had to take care of his niece and so couldn't make the meeting

Amy has the task of designing the UI
Oliver has the task of creating a cooldown for shooting the rockets and creating another rocket with a different interaction
Tom has the task of designing some pickups and some environmental hazards
George has the task of creating asteroids and some backgrounds

We spoke about some possible environmental hazards (Comets, Black holes) and also some possible pickups (armour, health, speed for example)
