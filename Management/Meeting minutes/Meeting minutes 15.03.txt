Members in attendance: Oliver, Amy

Tom sent an email on the 14th saying that he had overslept that day and could not make it to university in time due to missing a train the previous day.
George sent an email saying that he would not be attending meetings again this week. Both members did not attend meetings with lecturers either.

Both Tom and George did not complete any work for the previous week's sprint so they have been assigned these tasks again. As per Rob's instruction
George has been assigned non-essential work, and Tom's work (one task of which was carried over from the sprint before the one in question) has been 
reassigned to him however it is an important task which blocks one given to Amy this week so it has been communicated in the task description that this task
must be completed before saturday so as to allow Amy time to complete her task.

Oliver has been assigned bug fixing, implementing animations not covered by george's task and to change the way parts of the ui to work to show that they are cooldowns

Amy has tasks to change the black hole art to one that fits the games art style better, to create menu art and to collect playtesting feedback.
